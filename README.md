# Introduction
You can find in this repo a brief notebook of the final model that we used in Defi-IA 2021 competition.

# Task overview

This edition of the DÃ©fi IA pertains to NLP. The task is straightforward: assign the correct job category to a job description. This is thus a multi-class classification task with 28 classes to choose from.

The data has been retrieved from CommonCrawl. The latter has been famously used to train OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The data is therefore representative of what can be found on the English speaking part of the Internet, and thus contains a certain amount of bias. One of the goals of this competition is to design a solution that is both accurate as well as fair, as explained in the Evaluation section.
